## Database Design <a name="databasedesign"></a>
![Old Database ERD] (/readme_images/old_School_Database_ERD.png)

As you can see from the above picture I had a relational database that in my mind had all the fields necessary to function. I felt the most important aspect of the database was to show the marks and subjects and how they relate to the students. With a name and ID that was all that was needed to make this functional and most of the interesting side of the database would take place in the marks.

I then updated the design to add more emphasis on the students. This design also came about with an issue that arose that I will be discussing further in this documentation. I had ideas to progress this further and include a Teacher table that would be another one to many relation with a student having multiple teachers and whatnot however in the time given and with the issues that arose I did not get around to desinging this table.

## Risk Assessment <a name="riskassess"></a>

Some risks I have taken into consideration when designing this project are:
- Scope
  - I was aware of the timeframe I had to design and implement my coding for this project. I made sacrifices to accomodate for this, like for example not including the aformentioned Teacher table.
- Scalability
  - While it is not necessarily something I have to worry about for this piece of work I am aware that scalability could at some point become an issue with a similar project to this is a company setting. I have ensured that all of the storage is cloud based on an SQL server and virtual machine so that if the need were to arise I could pay for more space and very quickly get it through Google Cloud Services.
- CSRF Attacks
  - To help prevent these I have included the use of a secret key that is hidden within the environment and unable to be accessed.
- DDOS Attacks
  - While there is not much I can do to prevent this I am aware they could be a problem. As this is a small project a way to prevent the server being overloaded is to not give out the IP and access to the web address.

## Problems <a name="problems"></a>

I ended up running into a couple of problems throughout the course of this project.

###### Initial Plan
First of all I wanted to make it so that when you clicked on a student you would be able to add marks to them through their student information. Meaning it would automatically input the student's Student ID. I wrote the code for this and as far as I could see it should have worked. It did not however. Upon seeking advice from Victoria neither of us could work out why the code wasnt working. Nevermind I thought, though I will not be able to code this in the way I first wanted to I can still creat the code.

###### The Change
I then decided that the user should instead input the marks information manually, this however also ran into some syntax issues that after a while of checking I managed to reslove. For some reason, and only under this html form the hidden_tag() part which is usually written as such needed to have the brackets removed. Even though on two other html forms I had the exact same code and that wasn't an issue. This however then created another issue. That once again, code that was working in exactly the same way on other html files was not working on this one.

###### Conclusion
I brought these issues before Victoria again and once again she could find no immediate fault in my code and could not think as to what the issues could even be. So under her advice I abandoned the marks and the relational side of this project and focused more on implementing a more interesting CRUD table out of my working student one. Which is when I decided to flesh out the prexisting table into what it finally became.


## Testing <a name="testing"><a/>

![Test Results](/readme_images/Test_Results.PNG)

Looking at the test results above you can see there are two failed tests. I do not know why they have failed. As far as I am aware they are written correctly and I know the actual code works as I have used the program. The coverage is also quite low on my routes.py folder. This is because it still contains all of the routes in relation to the marks and the marks tables. I did not write the tests as I am not using them, however I could not remove the code as when I did so it broke the application.
